Praeses Blackjack Game:

This repository contains the contents of a Netbeans project folder containing Java code for my submission to the Praeses interview.

The program is a simple Blackjack game that uses SQLite to store game statistics, such as the number of games played, the number of wins, etc.

An executable jar file is included in the /dist folder so the game can be played without Netbeans.
